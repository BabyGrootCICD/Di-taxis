# Product Decisions

## Why non-custodial first
- Minimizes regulatory and custody risk
- Reduces blast radius of compromise

## Why start with XAUt route
- Liquidity and exchange coverage supports MVP execution needs
- Clear unit conversion for unified grams-based UI

## Why “resilience mode” vs “war mode”
- Broader applicability (outages, banking delays, travel continuity)
- Lower compliance and platform review friction

## Trade-offs
- UX friction (bring-your-own-keys)
- Reliance on third-party uptime
