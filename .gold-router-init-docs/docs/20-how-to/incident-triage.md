# How-to: Incident triage

## Triage flow
1. Classify severity
2. Contain (disable trading, revoke keys)
3. Preserve evidence (logs, timestamps)
4. Communicate status (internal + user-facing)
5. Recover and verify
6. Post-incident review and action items

## Artifacts
- Incident report template: `docs/templates/incident-template.md`
