# 0001: Non-custodial first

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Custody increases security, regulatory, and operational complexity.

## Decision
MVP will be non-custodial: users bring exchange API keys and wallets; the app does not hold funds.

## Consequences
- Lower custody risk
- UX complexity increases
- Clear permission scoping required
