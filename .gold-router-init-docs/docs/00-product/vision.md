# Vision

## Problem statement
Users want gold-linked exposure that remains usable under partial outages (exchange downtime, chain congestion, banking delays).

## Target outcome
Provide a non-custodial “gold router” that:
- optimizes execution across multiple venues,
- provides on-chain transparency,
- and supports a resilience mode playbook.

## Non-goals
- Custody/escrow of user assets
- Lending, leverage, or derivatives as part of MVP
- Legal/tax advisory functionality

## Key principles
- Non-custodial first
- Least privilege and minimal data retention
- Explicit risk controls and auditability
