# Compliance Notes (Non-legal)

## Positioning
This app is designed as a non-custodial tooling layer.

## What the app does
- Aggregates information
- Helps route trades (user-authorized)
- Tracks on-chain activity for user-owned addresses

## What the app does NOT do (MVP)
- Custody user funds
- Offer lending/interest products
- Provide fiat on/off-ramp
- Provide tax or legal advice

## Compliance considerations
- KYC/AML expectations vary by jurisdiction
- Exchange terms of service compliance
- Data privacy obligations for stored identifiers

## Review checklist
- Ensure minimal PII storage
- Ensure key handling meets best practices
- Ensure user consent and transparency
